class MaxPool2d(Module):
    r"""Applies a 2D max pooling over an input signal composed of several input
    planes.

    In the simplest case, the output value of the layer with input size :math:`(N, H, W, C)`,
    output :math:`(N, H_{out}, W_{out}, C)` and :attr:`kernel_size` :math:`(kH, kW)`
    can be precisely described as:

    .. math::
        \begin{aligned}
            out(N_i, h, w, C_j) ={} & \max_{m=0, \ldots, kH-1} \max_{n=0, \ldots, kW-1} \\
                                    & \text{input}(N_i, \text{stride[0]} \times h + m,
                                                   \text{stride[1]} \times w + n, C_j)
        \end{aligned}

    If :attr:`padding` is non-zero, then the input is implicitly padded with negative infinity on both sides
    for :attr:`padding` number of points.

    Args:
        kernel_size: the size of the window to take a max over
        stride: the stride of the window
        padding: implicit zero padding to be added on both sides

class AvgPool2d(Module):
    r"""Applies a 2D average pooling over an input signal composed of several input
    planes.

    In the simplest case, the output value of the layer with input size :math:`(N, H, W, C)`,
    output :math:`(N, H_{out}, W_{out}, C)` and :attr:`kernel_size` :math:`(kH, kW)`
    can be precisely described as:

    .. math::

    If :attr:`padding` is non-zero, then the input is implicitly zero-padded on both sides
    for :attr:`padding` number of points.

    Note:
        When ceil_mode=True, sliding windows are allowed to go off-bounds if they start within the left padding
        or the input. Sliding windows that would start in the right padded region are ignored.

    Args:
        kernel_size: the size of the window to take an avg over
        stride: the stride of the window
        padding: implicit zero padding to be added on both sides

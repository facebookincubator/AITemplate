class Conv2dBiasAddHardswish(Conv2dBiasAddAct):
    r"""Applies 2D convolution with bias + add + hardswish.

    Attributes:
        weight (Tensor): the learnable weights of the module of shape
            :math:`(\text{out_channels}, \text{kernel_size}, \text{kernel_size}, `
            :math:`\frac{\text{in_channels}}{\text{groups}})`.
        bias (Tensor):   the learnable bias of the module of shape
            (out_channels).

    Args:
        input (Tensor): the input tensor to apply 2D convolution on.
        residual (Tensor): the residule tensor to add after Conv2dBias.

    Examples::

        >>> m = nn.Conv2dBiasAddRelu(128, 256, 3, 1)
        >>> input = Tensor(shape=[4, 28, 28, 128])
        >>> residual = Tensor(shape=[4, 28, 28, 256])
        >>> output = m(input, residual)

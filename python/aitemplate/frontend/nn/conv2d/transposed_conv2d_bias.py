class ConvTranspose2dBias(ConvTranspose2dBiasAct):
    r"""Applies a 2D transposed convolution operator over an input image
    composed of several input planes.

    This module can be seen as the gradient of Conv2d with respect to its input.
    It is also known as a fractionally-strided convolution or
    a deconvolution (although it is not an actual deconvolution operation as it does
    not compute a true inverse of convolution). For more information, see the visualizations
    `here`_ and the `Deconvolutional Networks`_ paper.

    Args:
        in_channels (int): Number of channels in the input image
        out_channels (int): Number of channels produced by the convolution
        kernel_size (int): Size of the convolving kernel
        stride (int): Stride of the convolution
        padding (int, optional): Padding added to all four sides of
            the input. Default: 0
        dilation (int, optional): Spacing between kernel elements. Default: 1
        groups (int, optional): Number of blocked connections from input
            channels to output channels. Default: 1
        dtype (string, optional): Data type. Default: "float16"

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, H_{in}, W_{in}, C_{in})`
        - Output: :math:`(N, H_{out}, W_{out}, C_{out})`, where

          .. math::
              H_{out} = (H_{in} - 1) \times \text{stride} - 2 \times \text{padding} + \text{dilation}
                        \times (\text{kernel_size} - 1) + \text{output_padding} + 1
          .. math::
              W_{out} = (W_{in} - 1) \times \text{stride} - 2 \times \text{padding} + \text{dilation}
                        \times (\text{kernel_size} - 1) + \text{output_padding} + 1

    Attributes:
        weight (Tensor): the learnable weights of the module of shape
            :math:`(\text{out_channels}, \text{kernel_size}, \text{kernel_size}, `
            :math:`\frac{\text{in_channels}}{\text{groups}})`.
        bias (Tensor):   the learnable bias of the module of shape
            (out_channels).

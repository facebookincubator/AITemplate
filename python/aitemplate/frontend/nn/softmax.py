class Softmax(Module):
    r"""Applies the Softmax function to an n-dimensional input Tensor
    rescaling them so that the elements of the n-dimensional output Tensor
    lie in the range [0,1] and sum to 1.

    Softmax is defined as:

    .. math::
        \text{Softmax}(x_{i}) = \frac{\exp(x_i)}{\sum_j \exp(x_j)}

    When the input Tensor is a sparse tensor then the unspecified
    values are treated as ``-inf``.

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(*)` where `*` means, any number of additional
          dimensions
        - Output: :math:`(*)`, same shape as the input

    Returns:
        a Tensor of the same dimension and shape as the input with
        values in the range [0, 1]

    Args:
        dim (int): A dimension along which Softmax will be computed (so every slice
            along dim will sum to 1).

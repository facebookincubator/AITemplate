class AttentionBlock(nn.Module):
    """
    An attention block that allows spatial positions to attend to each other. Originally ported from here, but adapted
    to the N-d case.
    https://github.com/hojonathanho/diffusion/blob/1e0dceb3b3495bbe19116a5e1b3596cd0706c543/diffusion_tf/models/unet.py#L66.
    Uses three q, k, v linear layers to compute attention.
    Parameters:
        batch_size (:obj:`int`): The number of examples per batch.
        height (:obj:`int`): Height of each image example.
        width (:obj:`int`): Width of each image example.
        channels (:obj:`int`): The number of channels in the input and output.
        num_head_channels (:obj:`int`, *optional*):
            The number of channels in each head. If None, then `num_heads` = 1.
        num_groups (:obj:`int`, *optional*, defaults to 32): The number of groups to use for group norm.
        eps (:obj:`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1e-5): The epsilon value to use for group norm.
